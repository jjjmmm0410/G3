 ### 📍 What digital tool are you exploring, and what is its primary function? 
 #### ✏️ Using it as an online learning space!
 - Our tool we are exploring is Zep. It is a platform based on Metabus. Teachers can make an English class in a various form in virtual reality
 - It is a web-based program that does not require program installation, so it can be used easily. With a cute interface, voice sharing communication is possible in a virtual space where avatars exist.
 - In the new virtual reality space, a class space is created using YouTube, images, media, and quizzes. It functions to make learning more interesting and effective by conducting classes in this space.
 - As the untact culture spreads after COVID-19, remote education will also increase. In this regard, Zep plays a major role in allowing students to adapt to future education methods.

 ### 📍 How does this tool integrate with traditional English teaching methods? 
 #### ✔️ In traditional educational methods, face-to-face classes have several limitations.
  1. Only what the teacher has prepared in advance can teach.
  2. Less students participate because it is a teacher-centered and subject-oriented class.
  3. The cramming education and repeated exams will reduce students' interest and reduce their learning effects.
 #### ✔️🙆 Zep complements these limitations.
  1. Teacher can immediately create new class content in a virtual space
  2. Classes that can increase the participation of each student, such as OX quizzes and pictures in a virtual space, are possible.
  3. Tests are conducted to evaluate students' understanding, but interest and learning effects are increased through tests through various contents of Zep.
