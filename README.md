   We tried solving English questions through the O,X Quiz Room. To prevent cheating, other friends (connectors) are not visible.
   At the end, you can check your score and review any questions you got wrong.

   We used the classroom to look at a picture and do an activity where we put appropriate sentences into speech bubbles.
 
 
 ## 4. Questions 
 ### 📍 What digital tool are you exploring, and what is its primary function? 
 #### ✏️ Using it as an online learning space!
 - Our tool we are exploring is Zep. It is a platform based on Metaverse. Teachers can make an English class in a various form in virtual reality.
 - It is a web-based program that does not require program installation, so it can be used easily. With a cute interface, voice sharing communication is possible in a virtual space where avatars exist.
 - In the new virtual reality space, a class space is created using YouTube, images, media, and quizzes. It functions to make learning more interesting and effective by conducting classes in this space.
 - As the untact culture spreads after COVID-19, remote education will also increase. In this regard, Zep plays a major role in allowing students to adapt to future education methods.

    #### Example 1 - 🛜 Using non-face-to-face classes
 - Teachers can conduct classes in the classroom using audio and screen sharing with students.
 - Teachers can also show audiovisual materials through YouTube Imbad.

   #### Example 2 - 👥 Group Activity Space (Group Activity)
 - It is a space for group activities with 5-6 students.
 - Students can turn on the screen to study or share the screen with each other to carry out projects.
 - The group activity space is set as a private area, allowing voice/video and chat between group members only.

 ### 📍 How does this tool integrate with traditional English teaching methods? 
 
 #### ✔️ In traditional educational methods, face-to-face classes have several limitations.
  1. Only what the teacher has prepared in advance can teach.
  2. Less students participate because it is a teacher-centered and subject-oriented class.
  3. The cramming education and repeated exams will reduce students' interest and reduce their learning effects.
     
 #### ✔️🙆 Zep complements these limitations.
  1. Teacher can immediately create new class content in a virtual space.
  2. Classes that can increase the participation of each student, such as OX quizzes and pictures in a virtual space, are possible.
  3. Tests are conducted to evaluate students' understanding, but interest and learning effects are increased through tests through various contents of Zep.

 #### Example 1 - OX quiz room ⭕️❌
  - A survival quiz game in which participants(students) guess the quiz presented by the space manager(teacher) themselves, and if they get the correct answer, they survive.
  - If the question is asked, students will have 20 seconds, during which time students will go to the O or X area to select the correct answer.
  - Students who get the correct answer will remain in the OX quiz area and will automatically be moved to the review room if they fail.

#### Example 2 - Quiz!🔔 Golden Bell 🔔
 - Golden Bell is a survival quiz game in which participants(students) answer quizzes presented by teachers themselves.
 - Unlike the ox quiz, students can enter short answer questions.
